# README

Welcome to Neptune Dispatcher. I hope you enjoy it.


## Getting Started

The engine repo lives in lib/engine/. Everything else is your project. Note that some of the engine scripts are symlinked into scripts/ for convenience.

Use config/config.example.php as a starting point. Copy this file for each location you run this site. (Do not check into source control since you put passwords here.) Use ./scripts/select_config <sitename> to easily switch between local development and deployment server.

Most of your project lives in app/ under controllers, models, views, etc. It is very similar to Ruby on Rails and should be familiar to most web developers.  Note that the parent class for all controllers lives in lib/AppController.php. This is a template that you can change and own.

You can use ./scripts/generate to get started with example models, controllers, and migrations. Use ./scripts/migrate <up/down> and ./scripts/seed (after editing it, the seed is an example too) to set up your database. Use ./scripts/console to test out your model classes or do quick PHP experiments in the application's PHP environment (similar to Ruby on Rail's console).
